    "After installing `nbdev`, you can run `nbdev_install_hooks` in a terminal window *in the same directory as your repository*. This will [change the way](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/clean.html#nbdev_install_hooks) that Jupyter saves notebooks to [remove some unnecessary fluff](https://nbdev.fast.ai/api/clean.html#clean_jupyter) which will make your version control history much cleaner."

    "## Docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "[Docstrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring) are comments embedded in source code, usually at the beginning of a function or class. For example, here is a docstring:\n",
